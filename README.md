# Computer Science Web Quiz

## Description

This is a simple appliction that allows the user to take an interactive quiz with a timelimit and scoring system. Questions are focused around full stack web development. If the correct answer is selected, a point will be added to the score. If the wrong answer is chosen, 5 seconds will be deducted from the timer. Once the timer reaches 0, the quiz will end and the user will be presented with the option to add their score to the highscores list.
